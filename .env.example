# Environment Selection
# ==========================================
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Choose the right environment!

# Option 1: Mainnet (PRODUCTION - REAL MONEY) ⚠️
# Uncomment these lines for production:
#BYBIT_TESTNET=false
# (No custom URLs needed, will use mainnet automatically)

# Option 2: Demo Trading (RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING) ✅
# Uses "Demo Trading" mode - separate balance from main account
# Uncomment these for Demo Trading:
BYBIT_REST_URL=https://api-demo.bybit.com
BYBIT_WS_URL=wss://stream-demo.bybit.com/v5/public/linear

# Option 3: Testnet (Separate Environment with Fake Money)
# Uncomment for testnet (requires separate testnet API keys):
#BYBIT_TESTNET=true

# ==========================================
# Trading Parameters
# ==========================================
# Position size per trade
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD=100.0

# Stop Loss & Take Profit (optimized for scalping)
# Recommendation: SL wider than TP to avoid noise-triggered exits
# These values give ~65% required win rate for break-even
STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=0.8        # 0.8% - wider to reduce false triggers
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT=0.6      # 0.6% - realistic for scalping after fees

# Alternative profiles (comment out above and uncomment one below):

# AGGRESSIVE SCALPING (high frequency, requires 70%+ win rate)
#STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=0.3
#TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT=0.4

# CONSERVATIVE SWING (lower frequency, better R:R)
#STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=1.5
#TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT=2.0

# ==========================================
# Scanner Configuration
# ==========================================
# How often to scan market for better opportunities (seconds)
SCAN_INTERVAL_SECS=60

# Minimum 24h turnover to consider a symbol (USD)
# Lower value = more mid-cap altcoins (AXS, WIF, etc.)
# Higher value = only top liquid pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL)
MIN_TURNOVER_24H_USD=5000000.0     # $5M - allows mid-cap coins

# How much better a new symbol must be to switch (multiplier)
# 1.2 = new symbol must have 20% higher score to switch
SCORE_THRESHOLD_MULTIPLIER=1.2

# Alternative for only highly liquid pairs:
#MIN_TURNOVER_24H_USD=20000000.0   # $20M - only top tier

# ==========================================
# Risk Management
# ==========================================
# Maximum spread to allow entry (basis points, 1 bp = 0.01%)
# Lower = only very liquid pairs, Higher = allows less liquid pairs
MAX_SPREAD_BPS=30.0              # 30 bps = 0.3% spread max

# How old can market data be before considered stale (milliseconds)
STALE_DATA_THRESHOLD_MS=500      # 500ms threshold

# Notes:
# - Spread 10 bps = very liquid (BTC, ETH, SOL)
# - Spread 20-30 bps = moderate (LINK, AVAX, AXS during activity)
# - Spread >50 bps = illiquid (small caps, avoid)
